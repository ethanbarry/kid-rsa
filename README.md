# Kid-RSA

This is a simple pseudo-encryption algorithm from Dr. Grave's Algorithms & Applied Math
class at UT Tyler, intended for gaining familiarity with programming concepts.

See [this book](https://sj-graves.github.io/algorithms-book/sec-intro-kidrsa.html).

This Rust implementation leverages some of Rust's *functional* features, such
as `iter.collect()` and `.map()` functions.

## Building & Running

You can run the program after installing Rust by navigating to the source directory
and running:
```shell
cargo build
```
or run the unit tests with:
```
cargo test
```
